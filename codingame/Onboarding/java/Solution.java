// Most simple puzzle : you have to shoot down all enemies coming at you before they reach you. Each turn you have the choice between two enemies, so you just have to compare the distance that separates each one from you, and shoot the closest one.

class Player {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (true) {
            String enemy1 = in.next();
            int dist1 = in.nextInt();
            String enemy2 = in.next();
            int dist2 = in.nextInt();

            System.out.println(dist1 < dist2 ? enemy1 : enemy2);
        }
